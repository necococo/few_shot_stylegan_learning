# Few-shot style learning by stylegan2

(My first) Implementaion of [Few-shot Image Generation via Cross-domain Correspondence][1] in PyTorch.


GAN training generally requires a large number of training images, and training on a small number of data often results in overfitting.   
But in this paper, it was possible to do it with only 10 images.  


These are based on [stylegan2-pytorch repository][2] and [this weights][3] like written in the paper.  
I changed some lines in dataset.py, model.py and train.py.  
And I thank for the authors of this paper, stylegan2-pytorch repo, and torchextractor.  


## Requirements
torchextractor  
With google colab, I needed the ninja-linux.  
### I have tested on:
PyTorch 1.7.1  
CUDA 11.1  

## Usage 
Look at the [stylegan2-pytorch repository][2]  


## Results
